A) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	- When you work across multiple machines
	- When you work in a team of 2 or more people
	- When you want to easily share and have others take a look at what you're working on

B) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	- You might not want to get code others have uploaded until you are ready to go through it
	- In the case of pushing, you might want to finish the work you're doing before putting up on a public repository
	- Gives you more control over what changes make it down into your local copy and how you want to handle those changes

C) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	- A branch is a group of parent-child related commits within a git repository. Commits are related to each other via a tree structure
	and new branches can be created of the line of commits all within the same repository.
	- A clone, is a copy of a git repository that includes all the commits/branches and the associated history.
	- When a github repository is cloned on a github server, that is referred to as a fork.

	A clone is needed if a new copy of the repository is needed and you don't want to make any changes to the existing repository. A Fork is needed when you want to work on a respository on github, but you either don't want to make changes to the existing repository or you aren't allowed to make changes. A branch is needed if you want to keep working on the same repository but wish to group certain future changes together while allowing the original branch to be maintained separately.
